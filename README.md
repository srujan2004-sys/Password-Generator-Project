# 🔐 PyPassword Generator

A simple yet flexible **Python password generator** that creates strong, randomized passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols.  
This project is designed for **privacy** — passwords are generated locally and never stored or sent anywhere.

## 📜 Features

- Customizable number of **letters**, **numbers**, and **symbols** in your password.
- Two difficulty modes:
